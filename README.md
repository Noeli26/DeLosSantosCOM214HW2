I picked to make a online cupcake store where there is a selection of different flavors. I decided to have five flavors of cup cakes with different prices
depending on the size of the cup cake in a mini or regular size.
The html I use is Heading, Title, Div, Paragraphs, Table row with columns,table heading, I also used some new code to put in a emoji that I learned from w3schools.com
I am also using style to highligh the backrgound of my flavors 
I am also using hyper links to websites for recipes on cup cake flavors cookies and creaam : From preppykitchen.com,
 Dulce de leche: From ifyougiveablondeakitchen.com
 Chocolate: From sallysbakingaddiction.com
